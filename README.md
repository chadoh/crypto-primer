Bitcoin & Cryptocurrencies Primer
=================================

Sometimes I introduce non-technical audiences to the concepts of bitcoin and cryptocurrences. This is my slide deck.


How do I use this repo, though?
-------------------------------

These slides are built using [remarkjs](https://github.com/gnab/remark), which allows you to write your slides in nice simple markdown and turns them into beautiful, browser-powered slides complete with speaker notes. Read its readme to find out more about it.

I'm pretty proud of the styles I used for the slides. It took me a while to figure out how to override RemarkJS's styles in that way. If you enjoy it, feel free to copy it.
